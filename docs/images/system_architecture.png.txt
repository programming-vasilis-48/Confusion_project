This is a placeholder for the system_architecture.png file.

To generate the actual PNG image:

1. Use the Mermaid diagram in system_architecture.md
2. Go to https://mermaid.live/ and paste the diagram code
3. Export as PNG and save it as system_architecture.png in this directory

Alternatively, if you have Mermaid CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i docs/images/system_architecture.md -o docs/images/system_architecture.png
